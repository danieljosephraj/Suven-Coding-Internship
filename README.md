### 2.Data Analytics using Python Coding Projects

#### (i) Performing Analysis of Meteorological Data

The main objective is to perform data cleaning, perform analysis for testing the Influences of Global Warming on temperature and humidity, and finally put forth a conclusion.

#### (ii) Recognizing Handwritten Digits with Scikit-Learn

The primary aim of this project involves predicting a numeric value, and then reading and interpreting an image that uses a handwritten font.
we will have an estimator with the task of learning through a fit() function, and once it has reached a degree of predictive capability (a model sufficiently valid), it will produce a prediction with the predict() function. 


### 3.Market Basket Analysis using Association Rule - Mining Coding Internship

#### Association Rule Mining - Market Basket Analysis Using Apriori Eclat and Fpgrowth

Association Rules are widely used to analyze retail basket or transaction data, and are intended to identify strong rules discovered in transaction data using measures of interestingness, based on the concept of strong rules. The outcome of this type of technique is, in simple terms, a set of rules that can be understood as “if this, then that”.
